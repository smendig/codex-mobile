# Project Cron Automations

Project automations extend the existing sidebar automation UI from thread-scoped heartbeat records to project-scoped cron records.

## Storage

Project automations use Codex cron automation TOML records with `cwds = ["<project path>"]`. This matches Codex's project/folder automation shape while preserving thread heartbeat records that use `target_thread_id`.

## UI

The sidebar project row dots menu exposes `Add automation…` or `Manage automations…`. The dialog reuses the thread automation manager style, including multiple automation selection, schedule presets, status, and remove/save behavior.

Project rows show the same compact `Auto` chip when at least one project automation is attached.

## Boundaries

`Run now` remains available only for thread heartbeat automations because it queues a heartbeat message into a concrete thread. Project cron automations are scheduled against one or more working directories instead.
